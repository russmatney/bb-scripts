#+TITLE: bb-scripts

A handful of bb-scripts, mostly written while reading the babashka documentation.


* development
** running scripts
Scripts can be run via `bb -f <file>`, or if there is a hashbang and proper permissions, ./<file>.

#+BEGIN_SRC zsh
bb --classpath src --main cli -- -h
#+END_SRC

** running nrepl
run an nrepl server to connect to.

#+BEGIN_SRC zsh
rlwrap bb --nrepl-server 1667
#+END_SRC

This can be connected to from cider via cider-connect.
